# Hand Detection using MediaPipe

This project showcases hand detection using the MediaPipe library in Python. It captures video from a webcam and detects hands, drawing landmarks and connections on the detected hands.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the required libraries installed:

- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- MediaPipe (`mediapipe`)

You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/HandTracking.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd HandTracking
```

3. Run the Python script:
```bash
python HandTrackingModule.py

```

## About the Code
The provided Python script HandTrackingModule.py captures video from the webcam, performs hand detection using MediaPipe's Hands module, and displays the processed frames with drawn landmarks and connections.
